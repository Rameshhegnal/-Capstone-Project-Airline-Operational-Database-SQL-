# ✈️ Airline Operational Analysis – SQL Capstone Project

This project analyzes flight and route-level operational data for a simulated airline. The objective was to uncover delays, route efficiency, and aircraft performance trends by designing and querying a normalized relational database using SQL.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL ( PostgreSQL)** – Querying and data aggregation  
- **Database Schema Design** – Normalization and table relationships  
- **Joins, Aggregations, Filtering** – Core SQL operations

## ⭐ Project Highlights (STAR Format)

- **Situation**: The airline client needed insights into operations and performance across historical flight data to identify inefficiencies.  
- **Task**: Build and query a structured relational database to analyze delays, route performance, and operational KPIs.  
- **Action**: Created a normalized schema (Flights, Aircraft, Airports, Routes), and used SQL queries involving joins, groupings, and subqueries to extract insights.  
- **Result**: Provided clear metrics that informed delay mitigation strategies and operational optimization across high-traffic routes.

## 📊 Sample Insights
- ✈️ Certain city-pairs consistently faced longer delays due to late departures  
- 🛬 Specific aircraft types performed better on long-haul routes  
- 🛑 Cancellation patterns revealed bottlenecks in specific airports during peak hours
